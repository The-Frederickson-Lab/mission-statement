## CREATING A HEALTHY RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT

The Frederickson Lab studies mutualism. As such, we recognize and appreciate the value of reciprocally beneficial interactions, especially among individuals with distinct histories and ‘niches.’ As a lab, our primary goal is excellence in research, but we are guided by the belief that we do our best research when we work in a healthy and safe lab environment, when we recruit and support a diverse group of researchers, when we treat one another with respect and consideration, and when we achieve work-life balance. We expect all lab members to help establish and maintain a healthy, safe, diverse, inclusive, and considerate research environment. This mission statement provides more details about how we hope to work towards this goal.
